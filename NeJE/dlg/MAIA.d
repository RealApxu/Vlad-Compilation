  IF ~~ THEN REPLY ~I am <CHARNAME>. We were given little choice in coming here and arrived by magical means. You and that poor deranged soul outside this cave are all that our search of the area has uncovered, there does not appear to be any exits.You came here of your own free will, but appear to be unable to leave the same way, what goes on here Maia?~ GOTO 2
  IF ~~ THEN REPLY ~I am <CHARNAME>. From what I understand from that poor wretch outside, you are also trapped here. He mentioned a druid and spoke as if this was some game to him. You may be content to hole up here and die of hunger and thirst, I am not! Tell me where this druid hides himself and I will deal with him?~ GOTO 2
