    SAY DESC ~Ring of Gaxx
This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil.  Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power.  It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains.  The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

Allies are expensive in the City of Coin, and you have decided to invest in none of them. You have assassinated Gaelan Bayle and obtained a key from the lair of Aran Linvail, Shadowmaster of Athkatla. As ominous as that may sound, you have now little other choice but to plan an assault on Aran's lair to find any clue in your search for Irenicus.~ [theme4]

  After few hours of uninterrupted sail you see a shiny circlet on the horizon. It is the portal! Saemon slows "Gallante" down. Your seasoned captain looks nervous as the ship enters the time gate. "Athkatla" says he steadily... and the familiar harbor appears in view... You do not stop in the port however, but lay your course straight for Brinnlaw.

  The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliff side.~ [theme5]

He is currently undertaking his dejemma, a ritual journey to manhood, and is seeking adventure and glory in battle. It is also his honor to be the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir, and if anyone tries to harm her he will beat sense into their heads until they reconsider. He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon return to their homeland. So far Minsc considers his most notable experience in the world abroad to be the acquisition of his animal companion 'Boo,' a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. He seems a good-natured fellow, but is all too willing to indulge his berserker nature.~

BEGIN ~Improved Monk Class (by Vlad)~

STRING_SET 45867 ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Combat Abilities:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round; he gains 1/2 an  additional attack every 3 levels.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels.  All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE: this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks can cause 10% cumulative spell failure penalty applied for each successful hit on a spellcaster.
-  As the monk increases in levels, the damage his fists inflicts does as well:
 Level 1-2:   1-6
 Level 3-5:   1-8
 Level 6-8:   1-10
 Level 9-14:  1-12
 Level 15+:   1-20

Special Abilities:
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as he goes up in levels. His armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels.
-  Deflect Missiles (this ability gives a monk a -1 to their armour class vs missiles for every 3 levels).
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.

Monk's special abilities according to levels:
 Level 5:    Immunity to all diseases. Immunity to slowing and hasting effects.
 Level 7:    Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
 Level 8:    -1 to speed factor
 Level 9:    +1 to all saves. Immunity to charm. Fist become considered +1 weapons.
 Level 11:  Immunity to poison
 Level 12:  Another -1 to speed factor. Fists become considered +2 weapons.
 Level 13:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives them one hand attack. If they hit an opponent, the opponent must save or die. NOTE: this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
 Level 15:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
 Level 20:  Immunity to non-magical weapons

Magic Resistance:
 Level 14:    +42% (a special one-time bonus)
 Level 15-31: +3% per level until 100% maximum

Innate Abilities:
-  Invoke Courage once per day per 4 levels
-  Heal once per day per 4 levels
-  Death Curse once per day (at level 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36)

Disadvantages:
-  The monk cannot wear armor~

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, a caster is able to assume the form of a powerful creature (mind flayer, iron golem, greater wolfwere, earth elemental, fire elemental, or giant troll).  The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has almost all of its abilities. Thus, he can change into a mind flayer to stun his opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush his foes.  These creatures have whatever hit points the caster had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.

Note that the although the assumed form has the combat characteristics of the real creature, it may not have all of its immunities.~

SAY ~PRIEST OF SYLVANUS: This druid kit was especially created for Jaheira to reflect her unique personality.

Advantages:
-  She may specialize in any missile weapons she can use including light crossbows.
-  She gains +1 to hit, and +1 to damage with any missile weapon for every six levels of experience.
-  She has access to three innate abilities, which become available from her innate slots as she advances levels:

    Level 1, +1 to casting speed factor for 2 rounds
    Level 6, +2 to casting speed factor for 7 rounds
    Level 12, +3 to casting speed factor for 9 rounds
    Level 18, +4 to casting speed factor for 12 rounds.

    Level 9, +2 to attack speed factor and +1 to dexterity for 7 rounds
    Level 15, +3 to attack speed factor and +1 to dexterity for 9 rounds

Thus, she can change into a mind flayer to stun her opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush her foes. These creatures have whatever hit points Jaheira had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred. Note that the although the assumed form has the combat characteristics of the real creature, it may not have all of its immunities.

Disadvantages:

To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

  SAY DESC ~Blade Of The Night (enhanted by Cespenar)
This was the weapon used by the most famous assassin in Kara Tur, but none knew her name apart from the emperor. She was the greatest thief the world had ever seen. She received this powerful weapon after completing a series of succesful missions for the emperor, who decided she was worthy of the blade. It was made by the emperors best weapon smiths, and then tempered in the bloods of red, black, silver and blue dragons. The legend says this weapon would make anyone almost as good as thief as the original owner, but because of the strong enchantments, the katana requires much from its wielder, and it is only usable by a thief.

SAY ~wildwanderer of baervan~

SAY ~Wildwanderer of Baervan~

SAY ~WILWANDERER OF BAERVAN: This cleric kit was especially created for Aerie to reflect her unique personality.

Baervan Wildwanderer (BAY-ur-van WILD-WAN-der-er) is the god of forest-dwelling gnomes and their communities, travel, and the outdoors. He loves oak trees and all forest animals and is guardian of the wild. Baervan gifted forest gnomes with the ability to communicate with forest animals, and taught them to how to hide in and move through wooded environments without being detected. The Masked Leaf is the patron god of forest gnomes, but he is well loved by all of the gnome subraces. He is even revered by the svirfneblin as the Father of Fish and Fungus. Baervan is worshiped by those who love the woodlands, as well as many wanderers, thieves, fighter/thieves, and fighters, particularly those who prefer living in the outdoors rather than in a city all the time.

Baervan's friend and constant companion in his escapades is a giant raccoon named Chiktikka Fastpaws, who is highly intelligent but prone to act before he thinks. Many stories are told of the adventures that this duo has shared, often started by Chiktikka's humorous ability to get into trouble by borrowing something valuable, such as a minor artifact. Baervan is closely allied with the other gods of the gnome pantheon, with the notable exception of Urdlen. He works closely with Segojan Earthcaller, for both gods are concerned with the natural world.

Traditionally, their portfolios are divided between caring for forest animals and plants for Baervan, and burrowing animals for Segojan. Baervan sometimes accompanies Garl, or even Baravar, on their mischievous escapades, and the trio's shared interest in mischief embodies and encourages this aspect of the gnome psyche. Baervan's carefree nature and penchant for jests strains the patience of Gaerdal Ironhand, albeit not to the extent that the pranks of Baravar Cloakshadow do. Baervan is closely allied with many of the sylvan powers of the Seelie Court. His passion for oak trees has led to his endless, if so far fruitless, pursuit of Verenestra's affections. The Masked Leaf is a frequent participant in the councils of Emmantiensien, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus, though he rarely has the patience to sit through an entire discussion with these slow-speaking woodland giants. Baervan has few foes aside from Urdlen, although the Beastlord has earned his ire for hunting forest gnomes under the Masked Leaf's protection.

Baervan is gentle, good-natured, and mischievous. His penchant for good-natured pranks rivals Garl Glittergold. Except for Chiktikka's company, he tends to keep to himself. Though Baervan sometimes plays jokes on others, it is hard not to like him. The Masked Leaf's tricks are often designed to serve some purpose, unlike the mischief typical of Forgotten Folk. If Baervan wants to send someone a message, he does so in the form of a joke. Baervan dispatches avatars to help repair severe damage to nature, though sometimes just to create mischief.

The Masked Leaf may manifest as an amber radiance to settle over a worshiper or any type of plant. This manifestation can confer upon a favored worshiper the benefits of a spell such as 'barkskin', locate plants and animals, pass without trace, plant door, speak with plants, or tree or coalesce into a handful of goodberries. Baervan's manifestation can animate a tree as a treant for up to seven rounds, create a spike growth effect, or act as combined entangle and plant growth spells.

Baervan is served by forest animals of all types (particularly raccoons and giant raccoons), amber dragons, dryads, earth elementals, faerie dragons, feystags, hamadryads, hybsils, leprechauns, nature elementals, singing trees, sprites, swanmays, treants, wild stags, and wood giants. He demonstrates his favor by permitting his faithful to discover acorns, pieces of amber, emeralds, oak leaves or the sudden growth of plants on a welltrodden trail where such would seem out of place. The Masked Leaf indicates his displeasure by causing a tree branch to gently strike the target of his disaffection or by causing small animals to behave oddly (like pelting a gnome with acorns).

The church of the Masked Leaf is well regarded among most gnome communities, particularly forest gnomes, for Baervan and his followers are a likable bunch. Baervan's penchant for getting into trouble has long been a source of amusement and pride for the Forgotten Folk, and they generally embrace his mischievous nature as portrayed in the behavior of his clergy. Among other races, the church of Baervan is little known save among other elven and sylvan deities. The Fair Folk, particularly the Sy-Tel'Ques-sir, view the cult of the forest gnomes with great affection, as they do the followers of the Seelie Court.

Baervan's worshipers assemble in forest clearings to venerate their god, preferably sylvan glades ringed by a circle of ancient oaks, although such arboreal menhirs are not required. Longstanding shrines of the Masked Leaf are transformed into woodland chapels with the circle of broad trunks growing closer together and the canopy of intertwined limbs and leaves forming a natural roof.

Novices of Baervan are known as Acorns. Full priests of the Masked Leaf are known as Wildwanderers.

Advantages:
-  Wildwanderers of Baervan have an exceptional dexterity
-  They can specialise in any weapon that a cleric can use
-  Wildwanderers have a natural mind shield embedded in one of their personal items, i.e. they cannot be charmed, confused or affected by any mind-altering effects including pisonics
-  They can cast a limited number of spells relating to their forest and animal loving nature, which become available from their innate slots as they advance levels:
 At 2nd, 4th and 6th level, wildwanderers can cast Barkskin, Entangle and Baervan's Bilberries
 At 3rd, 5th and 8th level, wildwanderers can cast Charm Person or Mammal, Hold Animal and Zone of Sweet Air
 At 7th, 9th and 11th level, wildwanderers can cast Summon Insects, Call Woodland Beings and Animal Summoning I
 At 10th, 12th and 14th level, wildwanderers can cast Cloak of Fear and Animal Summoning II
 At 13th, 16th and 18th level, wildwanderers can cast Pixie Dust, Insect Plague and Animal Summoning III
 At 17th, 19th and 21st level, wildwanderers can cast Conjure Animals, Conjure Fire Elemental and Fire Seeds
 At 20th, 23rd and 26th level, wildwanderers can cast Conjure Earth Elemental, Confusion and Creeping Doom
 At 22nd, 25th and 28th level, wildwanderers can cast Elemental Summoning and Greater Elemental Summoning

At level 15, Wildwanderers of Baervan receive a Holy Symbol of Baervan.

SAY ~red wizard~

SAY ~Red Wizard~

SAY ~RED WIZARD OF THAY: The Red Wizards are the masters of Thay, the conquerors of that land's native Rashemi, and the would-be magical overlords of Faerun. They focus on a school of magic more intently than any specialist, achieving incredible mastery of magic within a very narrow focus. Seen as cruel and evil tyrants by people across Toril, a few choose to leave their region, assume secret identities, and practice magic without having to worry about political alliances and possible slave uprisings.

The Red Wizards at their height were the enemies of many forces in Toril and received support from demons, devils, and drow. Amongst those who opposed them were the Witches of Rashemen, the Seven Sisters and their allies, the goodly Harpers, and even the Zhentarim, who disliked the Wizards encroaching on their territory.

After another failed attempt at securing Rashemen in 1357 DR, the Red Wizards planned to infiltrate the nations of Faerun legitimately ' in Thayan enclaves which would publicly sell magic items and quietly also traffic drugs, wicked spells, and slaves. Using these they hoped to eventually have strongholds and resulting political infiltration that would make them indispensable and powerful, and eventually get them something along the lines of world domination.

Despite the general distrust and dislike that most felt towards the Red Wizards, the mages were still able to extend their power to almost every corner of the Realms, running their enclaves as planned in towns where slaving was otherwise banned. From here they ran a lucrative business in the trade of magical items, spells and artifacts, making them virtually indispensable to many of their clients, and as such the wizards expanded their sphere of influence ever further.

The final blow to the Red Wizards as they once stood came when the last remaining zulkirs, decades later, interrupted Szass Tam's plot to become a being of godlike power, preventing his ritual from reaching completion. Their efforts cost them their lives but likely saved Faerun from one of the greatest threats it might have ever faced and prevented Szass Tam from ever attempting the ritual again - at least so long as it was conducted on Thayan soil. For the Red Wizards however, the death of the zulkirs ended what the Red Wizards once had been and gave way for the new order.

The Red Wizards in the end transformed their old enclaves into their homes. What had once been a facade of a purpose, the accumulation of profit through selling magical items, became fact as the Red Wizards' goals transformed entirely. By 1479 DR few individuals associated the name "Red Wizard" with Thay but instead with a loose confederacy of merchant arcanists and those who believed otherwise were, in fact, mistaken.

Many traditions of the old Red Wizards were lost in the transformation and modern Red Wizards don't maintain the same Mulani traditions of shaved heads and tattoos that the old organization did. Most of the Red Wizards are actual wizards, but not all are, and the title of Red Wizard is generally inherited from parent to child, with exceptions in the case of adoption or marriage whereas in the past the Red Wizards were recruited from talented wizards. Red Wizard enclaves are essentially self-run, some by a single individual, others by a small council of wizards. Most of these enclaves are found within the lands bordering the Sea of Fallen Stars and those nations where Red Wizards are found almost certainly have an enclave within their capital city.

Advantages:
-  As many other Red Wizards, Edwin can specialise in any weapon that a mage can use.
-  In addition to spells Edwin learns, he can cast a limited number of conjuration/summoning spells, which become available from his innate slots as he advances levels:
 At 12th, 15th and 19th level, Edwin can cast Power Words of Silence, Stun and Blind
 At 14th, 20th and 26th level, Edwin can conjure Fire and Earth Elementals, and cast Prismatic Spray
 At 16th, 22nd and 28th level, Edwin can summon Efteeti, and draw the Symbols of Fear and Stun
 At 18th, 24th and 30th level, Edwin can summon Dark Planetar, and cast Gate and Dragon Breath

SAY ~darkcloak of shar~

SAY ~Darkcloak of Shar~

SAY ~DARKCLOAK OF SHAR: This cleric kit was especially created for Viconia to reflect her unique personality.

Shar, also known as Mistress of the Night, Nightsinger, Lady of Loss, or The Darkness, is the evil counterpart to her twin sister Selune, and presides over caverns, dark, dungeons, forgetfulness, loss, night, secrets, and the Underdark. Shar is an ancient goddess, formed together with her sister at the beginning of time, out of the empty nothingness that existed before gods or mortals. Among her array of twisted powers is the ability to see everything that lies or happens in the dark.

Since her earliest battles with Selune (which continue to this day), Shar has gained dominion over pain hidden but not forgotten, carefully nurtured bitterness, and quiet revenge for old slights. Deeply twisted, the Lady of Loss favors secrets, underhanded dealings, and subterfuge. She uses her mortal worshipers as pawns in a perverse game against everything that has been, is, and will be. Patron of the Shadow Weave, a corrupting magical force based upon nothingness and mad secrets, the Mistress of the Night bolsters her impressive power with temptation and guile.

The clergy of the Church of Shar use corruption and subversion to spread Shar's faith, but they must do this in secret in many places due to the religion being forbidden. The atmosphere of the organization is one of unwavering faith to its leader, Shar herself. Disobeying an order usually results in death. Although devotees are perfectly willing to give their life for Shar, she often does not intend for this to happen because it will deplete the number of her dedicated followers.

From time to time, Shar requests of her priests that a certain individual, usually a sorcerer or wizard who she deems to have misused the Shadow Weave, is killed. On the other hand, Shar can forbid such acts against specific individuals. It is not uncommon for the church to make use of the Shadow Weave itself, although Shar holds onto the deepest and most powerful secrets of the magical force.

The clergy of the church will travel in small groups or individually throughout Faerun, often disguised as merchants or pilgrims to avoid detection. Their missions usually involve either espionage or murder.

The church is split into individual cells that can operate independently from one another, often having a temple or shrine as their focal point. Cells are linked by the leadership of a priest, and one priest will typically control the cells in a geographic area. Priests communicate with one another, but rarely reveal truthful information to their inferiors.

The intent of the Church of Shar is to spread the faith of Shar. This is achieved by undermining and corrupting individuals, governments and even other religions. This enables the subject to be more likely to accept the views and dogma of Shar. Because the most valuable commodity to the clergy of Shar is a secret, information is closely guarded and is only revealed when it is essential to be known. The clergy of Shar will expect that a secret is traded for another similarly prized secret.

By revealing secrets, Sharran clergy will attempt to incite bitterness and jealously within individual, such as telling a woman that her husband is having an affair. These emotions are strongly embraced by Shar and highly increase the likeliness of a successful conversion.

There are several orders in the Church of Shar: the Dark Justicars who have to kill a priest of Selune to gain admittance to the order, the Servants of the Dark Moon who tap into the Shadow Weave through their powers of sorcery, and the "Nightbringers", the elite Sharran forces.

Unusual among other orders in the Church, the "Darkcloaks" were actually a compassionate group of oracles and caregivers who tended to those troubled souls who were emotionally damaged, often bringing the bliss of forgetfulness to soothe their pain. Their work did much to present the church in a positive light to the populace, though too often the reaction was still negative. This order included some of the few non-evil clerics in the Church, and Viconia is one of them.

Advantages:
-  They can specialise in any weapon that a cleric can use
-  Darkcloaks have a negative plane protection and a natural mind shield, both embedded in one of their personal items, i.e. they cannot be level or energy drained and they cannot be charmed, confused or affected by any mind-altering effects including pisonics
-  They can cast a limited number of spells, which become available from their innate slots as they advance levels:
 At 2nd, 4th and 6th level, darkcloaks can cast Cure Disease, Neutralize Poison and Remove Paralysis
 At 3rd, 5th and 8th level, darkcloaks can cast Iron Skins, Lesser Restoration and Death Ward
 At 7th, 9th and 11th level, darkcloaks can cast Cause Serious Wounds, Cause Critical Wounds and Slay Living
 At 10th, 12th and 14th level, darkcloaks can cast Heal and Harm
 At 13th, 16th and 18th level, darkcloaks can cast Physical Mirror and Greater Restoration
 At 17th, 19th and 21st level, darkcloaks can cast Finger of Death and Creeping_Doom
 At 20th, 23rd and 26th level, darkcloaks can cast Storm of Vengeance and Summon Fallen Deva

  SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Carsomyr~
  SAY DESC ~The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr
Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

This enhanced Carsomyr was forged by Cromwell by combining the original Lilarcor with the powerful Carsomyr that only paladins could use. The enhanced Carsomyr is made even greater than the original Carsomyr and may be used by any fighting class.

//3. Selune's Promise +5
COPY ~NeJE/bdash/cromwell/SIMACE3.ITM~ ~override/SIMACE3.ITM~
  SAY NAME2 ~Selune's Promise +5~
  SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune's Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime's mother.

It turns to be that Cromwell inherited the secret knowledge from his ancestors of rithelium weapons and how to forge them. This mace that he reforged with rithelium and with your assistance is extremely light and gives off a shimmering blue hue. It is usable by wizards as if proficient in their use, grants magical resistance to the wearer and can strike through magical defences of the enemies.

    SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Robe of Armory~
    SAY DESC ~There are a small number of these valuable robes floating around the Realms, and all of them are the creation of an abjurer named Delgam of the Many Hands - so called for his extensive use of the expression "on the other hand..." Delgam eschewed imbuing his items with offensive powers or other miscellaneous magic effects. Instead, he focused on what abjurers tend to focus on: defense. His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well known legacy.

This particular robe was enhanced by Cromwell.

A diminutive human mage, Gulph didn't want to be stuck in a situation where he would have to rely on his physical abilities. This staff helped him have the upper hand in magical duels. Gulph met his end when he foolishly went looking for Ibenian Mushrooms in a grove full of quicklings. The staff remained among the quicklings for several years until a passing party of adventurers slaughtered the evil fae creatures and took the staff as their own.

  SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Messenger of Sseth~
  SAY DESC ~This wicked bow was crafted thousands of years ago for a powerful yuan-ti archer named Apali. The number of men, women, and children Apali killed with the aid of the bow is almost unbelievable, as the soldier waged war against humans for hundreds of years before he was finally laid low in Chessenta by a priest of Assuran, god of vengeance. Apali had killed the priest's great-great grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier. The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow. The red and black bandings represent Apali's family, from a caste of priests. The snake heads represent Sseth, the god of the yuan-ti.

This is the true name that the dwarven weaponsmith, Silverblade, gave to the weapon he intended to create for his son.

A Sembian by birth, Ogi-Luc was a powerful man, as strong in body as he was in mind. However, Ogi-Luc wasn't content to merely be strong. He wanted to be exceptionally strong. When he put on this robe, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim. Nesk took the robe as a prize. It were later stolen and sold by a daring rogue.

//Flame Tongue (Enhanced by Cromwell)
COPY ~NeJE\bdash\itm\FLAMSW1H.ITM~ ~override~
  SAY DESC ~Flame Tongue +4 (Enhanced by Cromwell)

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

Combined with the Hell Bane sword, this weapon is also the bane of certain lower planes creatures and vampires. Against Baatezu and Tanar'ri the sword inflicts additional damage and the user gains a +4 to both hit and damage. As for vampires, the sword has a chance to slain them on touch. While held, the sword also grants complete protection against poison, disease and fire being magical or not.

STATISTICS:

Equipped Bonuses:
 Immunity to Fire (magical or non-magical)
 Immunity to Poison and Disease

Combat Abilities:
 If any vampiric creature is hit it must save vs. spells or be utterly destroyed.

    SAY DESC ~This suit of armor is formed from interlocking crimson dragon scales. It is light of weight, strong, and resistant to fire and magic. Because of these properties it is much sought after, but finding, let alone slaying, a powerful ancient dragon is nearly impossible. It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one. One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly crimson ones.
