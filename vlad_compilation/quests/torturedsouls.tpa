  After Saemon Havarian had finished his incantations you stood for a few minutes in expectation. The ship, ready to sail was still in Athkatla's docks... You were about to sigh and pronounce your thanks that at least it was not frog-turning, and request refund from the sly sailor. Suddenly the crew became agitated, everyone pointing to the east. You turned and saw a gray cloud speeding across the sky straight for the "Gallante". A few of the crewmen leaped overboard. Someone behind your back whispered: "that's how the fate looks?" and spat heartily on the deck. Then the world became one great gray fog and all you could sense is the movement of tremendous speed... But you could not distinguish the direction or count the time... Slowly you had lost your consciousness... and regained it in what seemed a short instant. The ship is riding shallow waters in a sheltered bay by a stony beach. Captain Havarian approaches you hesitantly...~ [theme3]

  After few hours of uninterrupted sail you see a shiny circlet on the horizon. It is the portal! Saemon slows "Gallante" down. Your seasoned captain looks nervous as the ship enters the time gate.   "Athkatla" says he steadily... and the familiar harbor appears in view... You do not stop in the port however, but lay your course straight for Brinnlaw.

  Bodhi was as good as her word. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliff side.~ [theme5]

But the adventurous witch soon embarked on another dajemma accompanied by her new guardian. The man had wits and was a valiant fighter. However, it was later said, Dynaheir had never been pleased with his service. She had relieved him of his duties and traveled alone thereafter. The mage was also known to keep hamsters. Later in her life she got married to an ambitious mage from Tethyr and they opened a school of magic together. It can be hoped that one day they will come to love each other.~

Because of that, Aran Linvail was eventually forced to retire. He went with Sime to a small village in Northern Amn where Sime was offered the position of ranger-protector, despite her background. Aran was so bored that he started to take interest in local politics and within a few years the community had become known as a tax haven. The bureaucrats in Athkatla had believed for years that it was just a nameless hamlet, while in fact it was a prominent trade post.  Aran stayed as mayor of the community until his death.

Sime took one look at her father's plans for their wedding and that very night she convinced <CHARNAME> to elope. To lay the issue to rest they got married in the Druid's Grove shortly after.

Pressure from admirers within the local nobility saw him taking up the mantle of Chief Inspector, a responsibility he never desired but took on willingly to combat the growing corruption within the city.  For many years, Valygar's was the name spat by every criminal or slaver who dared to place a foot within the city.  Valygar was dauntless, turning the city garrison into a force even the most self-confident thief had to respect.  Valygar and the Shadow Thieves sparred many times, eventually reaching a point of mutual respect...though most considered the ranger the victor even then.  Surprising even himself, Valygar eventually restored the good name of the Corthalas in Athkatla and even married.  His only son, the pride of his life, took the lessons of his father to heart?

The Hashimoto family first doubled then tripled and all of their children grew up during the endless family journey. The eldest child was called <CHARNAME> in memory of their old friend. Yoshimo and Kachiko never returned to Kozakura, the demise of their families weighed heavily on them. Eventually, they retired to Athkatla.

Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the morning star, saving the matching ring for a special time.

    SAY NAME2 ~The Black Bow~
    SAY DESC ~A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faerun.  A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart.  Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings.  He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle.  In the lands north of Baldur's Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm.  Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan's.  Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan's home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead.  His farm was burned to the ground.  Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood.  He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with.  Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan's death, it was blessed by a god.  Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal.  Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan's actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

He wanted the ability to summon allies at a moment's notice without giving away his intention.  For that reason, he created a wide variety of chess sets of different colors that would summon constructed, golem-like automatons to aid him in battle.  Almost all of Niri Alud's chess sets were lost when he was attacked by desert raiders in Calimshan.  The raiders, ignorant of the ways of magic, let most of the chess sets sink into the desert sands.  The chess sets that were taken were soon separated, pieces traveling through trade and theft over hundreds of miles.  Treasure hunters search for the pieces still.

    SAY DESC ~Amulet of Blessing

This amulet bears the repeating angular geometric patterns that the long-dead craftsmen of Myth Lharast were known for. Considered plain by modern elven standards, the amulet was a gift to Kiran-Hai, Circle Singer of Angharradh and Ward Mistress of the Arboreal Tombs in Myth Lahl. The name of its creator has been lost. It is believed to have been blessed later by priestesses of Selune, goddess of the moon. Sime inherited this amulet from her mother, and never takes it off.

    SAY DESC ~Aran's Cloak of Protection

The origins of this cloak have been lost in the mists of time. However, for some time it was in the possession of Drosus, a mage of no small power from Waterdeep. Drosus fell afoul of an unusually large group of winter wolves on a solo expedition into the Spine of the World mountains having been forced to don a heavier cloak to keep out of the cold...

The cloak grants a +3 bonus to Armor Class and can be worn in combination with any other form of protection enchantment - thus it can be worn over magical armor unlike a cloak of protection.

It was a rumor that once upon a time when Aran Linvail was a young adventurer, he fell in love with an elven girl. She was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen in his life. In order to protect his lover in their travels, he asked one of the famous Calimshite merchants to bring him the most invulnerable leather armour he would find. In two months the merchant brought this excellent set of studded leather armour to Aran, but it was too later. His lover was shot dead by a goblin archer in a forest of Tethyr. Aran has kept this armour for a long time in remembrance of his short and passionate love, and eventually bestowed this armour to his favourite guild master.

    SAY NAME2 ~Selune's Promise~
    SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune's Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime's mother.

    SAY NAME2 ~Three White Doves~
    SAY DESC ~An extremely unusual mace, Three White Doves was created by an Ilmaterian priest named Alledec in 850 DR. Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away. This ivory-headed mace was the result. The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory. Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place. The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace. It is carved from pure ivory and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon. The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace. It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater. The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold. Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest. Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

"I am Kachiko of House Nakanishi," she says in a soft voice, and proceeds to tell you about her far-away native land. She speaks of temples which roofs are shaped as mountains slopes, gardens set amongst stones, of brave warriors who obey a code as strict as it is honorable, of pearls brought from the sea depth, and of Emperors and millions of spirits populating her land until you interrupt her with: "But what about you, Kachiko?" She smiles and answers: "I am Kachiko of House Nakanishi. I am what you see in front of you, my friend. Look into my face and you can read my past, my present and my future."~

Sime Linvail visits Athkatla once in a while to meet with her father. These meetings however always end up in an argument over Aran's dealings and Sime flees the city vowing never to come back.~
