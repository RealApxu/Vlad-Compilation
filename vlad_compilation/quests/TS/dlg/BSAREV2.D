  SAY ~Corthala, I have noticed that you give an increasing portion of your attention to my little sister.~

END

IF ~~ THEN BEGIN TS147
  SAY ~(*chuckle*) I know a bit of problematic family backgrounds myself, ranger. My question is this, then. You would seem to get awfully well along with my little sister, and yet, according to your beliefs, she has no freedom of choice but to be corrupted by her power. This begs a question. What are your intentions with her?~

IF ~~ THEN BEGIN TS149
  SAY ~She is a child of the Lord of Murder, Valygar. So am I. If there is anything to learn from this it is that what we are does not dictate our path. I would like you to think on that.~

IF ~~ THEN BEGIN TS151
  SAY ~I was tormented in the Nine Hells for many endless days. I have endured tortures and unimaginable pain. I lost all I had, even the very humanity I was so eager to shake away in my haste to become a god. What I have now is a half-existence... Yet I am happy to have a shadow of life I once had. And it was given to me by my sister.~

  SAY ~Listen to me then. Know that I have felt the despair of the darkest pit of the Abyss, as well as ridden the soaring wave of euphoria akin that of the highest mountaintop of Celestia. I have left the fields of battle awash with blood, the joy of battle still surging in my veins like the poison of dead god in my soul in the height of my madness.~

END

IF ~~ THEN BEGIN TS168
  SAY ~Neither is true. Fear? I never knew what it is. The moment I knew that I was about to die I was not fearful, I was surprised. Redemption? Is it my place to seek redemption? My hands did what was done, but my father was in command of my heart, not me.~
