~An actor is as many entities as he recreates for the great gods of THEATER, yet I also have had many experiences in my life, which made me a poet... Kachiko, if I only could draw for you the many visions of mystery and grandeur I had witnessed in my travels! The half-ruined palaces veiled by the clouds of multicolored vapors, surrounded by ocean of melting mercury and hidden between the planes... People of other spheres covered in radiance... Females painted by henna from head to toe, dancing and singing in ecstasy...~

~I easily believe it, my seagull. Your voice is melodic and your steps are light. You were born to be a minstrel.~

~My sweetest Lady, I am just dreamy because

I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful, a faery's child;
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.~

~My Lady will not allow a poet romantic exaggeration?~

~I was made that way.
When I wish to laugh
I laugh till it hurts.

I love the one who loves me
And is it really my fault
that it is not the same man
I love every night?~

CHAIN BHAERDA TS183
~As my Lady demands. Let me find a melody sweet enough to engage the interest of the seagull.

I bring you with reverent hands
The books of my countless dreams,
White woman that passion has worn
As the tide wears the dove-gray sands,
And with heart much older than the horn
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:
White woman with numberless dreams,
 I bring you my passionate rhyme.~

CHAIN BHAERDA TS184
~Why Sime? Your heart will not listen tonight to a poet's plea for love?~
