== BJAN ~Ah, but Leina my girl, would there be enough paper in Amn to cover all of the Jansen clan? More to the point, could I remember them all because if I was to write about some and not others Jan Jansen would be ostracised and sent to Coventry, wherever Coventry is. Only one other Jansen has been sent there and that was when...~
== VPLEIB ~Now that is exactly what I mean Jan, someone in your family has done just about everything a person can think of and somethings that no-one would want to think of. You would be famous Jan.~
== BJAN ~Jan Jansen the author and the inventor, now I like the sound of that.~
== BJAN ~The question is what to call this book of mine that is going to make me and the Jansen family famous... maybe "The Lord Of The Turnip Field" or... "The Importance Of Being Jansen", or maybe even... "Three Gnomes In A Boat".~

== VPLEIB ~I would think there are enough tales for you to write several books Jan. Choose which title you like best, you already have your plot or plots and away you go. I can see you will soon have enough books to fill Candlekeep library twice over.~

== BVALYGA ~Are you asking, do I see myself as a warrior or as a woodsmen?~
== VPLEIB ~I am. Tell me who is really behind the sombre man who stands and protects both man and creature alike?~
== BVALYGA ~I don't see myself as sombre. I am not at home in the city and I do prefer my own company that is true but my life hasn't given me much to rejoice in either.~
== BVALYGA ~I do however take delight in the open spaces and the smell of the forest and all its creatures but, at the same time, I also respect that it is their habitat and that I am the intruder when I walk amongst the trees, so if I can avoid killing a creature by befriending it then I will. No, I do not see myself as sombre at all.~
== VPLEIB ~Then perhaps we should frequent the woods and the forests more often. On the chance that we might see a more relaxed Valygar and the fire in his eyes would burn a while longer.~
== BVALYGA ~(*Laughs*) Leina... Leina, you are truly a bard. For one crossed in love you still have poetry in your soul.~
== VPLEIB ~(*Laughing with him*)... And what of Valygar, has he also been crossed in love? Can that be why he prefers the company of the one person who cannot hurt him, namely Valygar?~
== BVALYGA ~My story is not for the telling of bards. It is for my knowing alone. Too many have had their lives exaggerated by a bard's tale and as long as mine remains within me it stays true and uncomplicated.~
== VPLEIB ~Unlike the man himself. I do not think anyone will ever see you as an uncomplicated man Valygar. Be it ranger, woodsman or warrior, however you see yourself, you have a fire within you that one day you will not be able to contain.~
== BVALYGA ~I have contained that fire for a long time now Leina, I think I can safely say that it is almost quenched.~
== VPLEIB ~Ah, but fires are funny things! Especially those which seem to be almost quenched. As long as there is a spark it takes but a small amount of fuel and it will become a conflagration. Be wary my friend is all I will say, for the fuel can come from the least likely of places and at the most unexpected of moments.~
== BVALYGA ~Then I must be sure to carry plenty of water in my waterskin should this fire erupt some day.~

== BNALIA ~It's this blasted shoe of mine! Look at it, a hole right through the sole and a stone has gotten inside.~
== VPLEIB ~Come here, take your shoe off and let me see. I can see you are not used to walking the rough road, these are court shoes not walking shoes. You need to get yourself a stout pair of boots the next time we visit a store.~
== BNALIA IF ~!Dead("Torgal")~ THEN ~Ouch, that hurt. I was not expecting to be on the road, those damn trolls never gave me the chance to change my shoes or anything else for that matter. Damn them and whoever told them the De'Arnise keep was worth plundering! I hope their murderous carcases rot in the Abyss!~
== BNALIA IF ~Dead("Torgal")~ THEN ~Ouch, that hurt. I guess I wasn't thinking clear enough after my father's death to consider that I wasn't suitable attired for hard travelling. Damn those trolls and whoever told them the De'Arnise keep was worth plundering! I hope their murderous carcases rot in the Abyss!~
== VPLEIB ~Sorry Nalia, but if you keep your foot still this might not hurt so much. It does not look as though the damage is too bad, more bruised than cut. Still it is going to be sore for a while. Here, you best put your shoe back on, it will be better than nothing on your foot.~
== BNALIA ~(*Putting her shoe back on*)... Thanks Leina, I guess it's true what they say about bards knowing a little of everything, even a bruised foot. Auntie would have a fit if she saw the state these shoes are in, *not fit to be seen on the feet of even the peasants* she would say.~
== BNALIA ~(*Giggling*) Come to think of it she would probably have an apoplexy if she saw the state of the rest of me!~
== VPLEIB ~If anyone were to ask me, I would say that you are looking a lot healthier for being out of that musty old keep. You have colour in your cheeks and even your eyes look more alive now. Get yourself some boots, maybe more suitable clothes and you will do nicely Nalia.~
== BNALIA ~I have to admit I feel good too, being on the road, doing good things and helping others. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Only Auntie would never let me on account of her blaming my mother's death on her having been contaminated by the peasants.~
== VPLEIB ~Fiddlesticks I say! Who cares what the Aunties of the world believe as long we feel good about ourselves, that is what counts.~
== VPLEIB ~Come, I will walk behind with you as you are not going to keep up too well with the rest of the group until that bruise of yours goes down. As soon as we can we are going to hit the stores and together we are going to do some serious shopping.~

== VPLEIB ~I am not some helpless half elf who has recently left the sanctuary of her forest home Edwin! I can handle a sword and magic as well as I play any instrument, so your concern is not necessary but thank you all the same.~
