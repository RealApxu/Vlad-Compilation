CHAIN MARIA MariTk2
~I... wasn't in. Lately bandits have gone completely out of control, so I took more guards with me.~
EXTERN KELDORJ MariTk3

CHAIN MARIA MariTk3
~I feared to go with only a casual escort.~

CHAIN MARIA MariTk4
~Almost... I... I left two of them at home. I thought they could call for help if they needed to.~

CHAIN MARIA MariTk5
~Thieves do not go singly nowadays you know. They killed the guards at the doors, quietly and fast. The soldiers outside never heard a thing. Leona managed to open a window and called out for help before she was shot by a crossbow. The soldiers ran in when they heard her shouting, but... Vesper was murdered right in her bed. Oh, Keldorn, it was so very dreadful!~

~Keldorn! Why do you say that I...~
EXTERN KELDORJ MariTk7

CHAIN MARIA MariTk7
~No! You were indifferent to me. But I tried to please you in everything, I was a good mistress, I was bringing up your children... Isn't it enough?~

CHAIN MARIA MariTk8
~(Surprised) My parents told me the paladins' marriages are never contracted for love, and that I would get used to you... Besides you were so... interesting, respected, even my friends were jealous of my good fortune.~

~Look here! You have had enough time to turn her head. Ah, this is all so... so romantic, the suffering and wronged hero, a somewhat new role for you Keldorn!~
EXTERN KELDORJ MariTk15

CHAIN MARIA MariTk13
~What?! I must shut my mouth? You, an old man with grey hair, you leave everything ' me, our girls, your well-beloved Order, ' and you throw yourself after a wench to... hm, what was it that you said? To rescue her playmate! Leaving me to learn from outsiders where you were and who you were with!~

CHAIN MARIA MariTk14
~Don't you 'Maria' me! I have become old, I've cried my eyes out, while wasting my life waiting for you for years... Now when such a horrible thing has happened, I thought you are going to come and comfort me! Instead you have come... with this... semigod! How can you, Keldorn... and you dare to accuse me of infidelity!~
EXTERN KELDORJ MariTk17

CHAIN MARIA MariTk15
~I fail to remember a single time when you hugged me in public.~
EXTERN KELDORJ MariTk19
