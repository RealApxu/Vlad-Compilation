== NJDARJ ~Forgive my appearance my lady. I know how abhorrent I am to the eye of the females of your race, but you can be assured, Dar needs no babysitting.~
== VPSHAJ ~(*Bursts out laughing*)... My what... my lady! You'd do well half orc to remember that there is no namby-pamby ladyness to Shar-Teel!~
= ~While we're at it, I'll have none of your pious spoutings about your god and eternal damnation or you'll be wishing <CHARNAME> had let the wolves disembowel you...~
