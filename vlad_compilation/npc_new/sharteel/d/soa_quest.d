What ever name you go by, I recognise the father's eyes looking out from the daughter's face... eyes as dark and pitiless as those of Angelo Dossan's are not easily forgotten.~

One only remembers what they fear and I remember not even the gutter snake of a man you mention! So if you're hoping to collect some debt owed you, I warn you, if you try to collect, the only payment you'll get from me will be in steel!~

Ah... a most excellent pupil he was too, devious but gifted.~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Yea gods, is there no limit to a male's ego? Men really are pathetic! You must have a tapeworm in your brain addling it if you expect me to believe that it was you who taught him... you who are too weak to protect your own!~

I was his teacher and all that he was he owed to me. Mind you, he paid handsomely for his knowledge!~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~When first he approached me I was amused by the man's audacity, but it wasn't long before I saw a kindred spirit in him. A man whose quick and devious mind came second only to my own.~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~So I undertook to teach him a fraction of what I know, but it was enough and he left content... besides, it had been a while since anyone had plucked up nerve enough to seek me out. No one has sparked my interest or deemed themselves worthy of my notice since.~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Why the egotistical braggart... curses on me for believing a male's pathetic fantasies! His ego was bigger than yours! (*Then letting her fingers stroke the hilt of her sword... flames begin to flicker at her fingertips*)...~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~If what you say is truth then I have a proposition for you. You return that which he paid you with and I'll not show these good people the true colour of a coward's heart. A fair trade wouldn't you say?~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~(*Smirks*) Looks can be deceptive my girl... believe me when I say you'll not find me an easy target for that sword of yours!~
