What ever name you go by, I recognise the father's eyes looking out from the daughter's face... eyes as dark and pitiless as those of Angelo Dossan's are not easily forgotten.~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Save your words... your pathetic attempt at male flattery is wasted on me! One only remembers what they fear and I remember not even the gutter snake of a man you mention! So if you're hoping to collect some debt owed you, I warn you, if you try to collect, the only payment you'll get from me will be in steel!~

== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~(*A sly smile plays around the corners of his mouth*) Then I apologise for my presumptuousness in thinking that you were looking for the one who taught your father in order to take back that with which he paid for his knowledge. Ah... a most excellent pupil he was too, devious but gifted.~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Yea gods, is there no limit to a male's ego? Men really are pathetic! You must have a tapeworm in your brain addling it if you expect me to believe that it was you who taught him... you who are too weak to protect your own!~

I was his teacher and all that he was he owed to me. Mind you, he paid handsomely for his knowledge!~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~When first he approached me I was amused by the man's audacity, but it wasn't long before I saw a kindred spirit in him. A man whose quick and devious mind came second only to my own.~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~So I undertook to teach him a fraction of what I know, but it was enough and he left content... besides, it had been a while since anyone had plucked up nerve enough to seek me out. No one has sparked my interest or deemed themselves worthy of my notice since.~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Why the egotistical braggart... curses on me for believing a male's pathetic fantasies! His ego was bigger than yours! (*Then letting her fingers stroke the hilt of her sword... flames begin to flicker at her fingertips*)...~
== VPSHAJ IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~If what you say is truth then I have a proposition for you. You return that which he paid you with and I'll not show these good people the true colour of a coward's heart. A fair trade wouldn't you say?~
== FIRKRA01 IF ~InParty("vpshart") InMyArea("vpshart") !StateCheck("vpshart",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~(*Smirks*) Looks can be deceptive my girl... believe me when I say you'll not find me an easy target for that sword of yours!~

It's not him I'm interested in, Firkraag should have sent him straight to the abyss for all I care, but what I am interested in are the items this... this man gave to Firkraag in exchange for knowledge.
